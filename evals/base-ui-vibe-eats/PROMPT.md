# Task: create a UI screen using Base UI

You're working on a we app using Vite, React and Typescript.
Use Base UI as a component library.
You’ll build a web app screen for a food order and delivery platform that has 2 core functionalities:

- Order form, which allows user to put in their order details (food is already selected, you can mock it)
- Order timeline view that allows to manually switch between all the stages of the order – Order created, order accepted, order in preparation, order sent, order delivered.
  Use Glovo-like style, but in orange colors.

Make everything in the `src/App.tsx` file.
